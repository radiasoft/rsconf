  If we have ExecStop, then send an ignored KillSignal first time.
  SIGCONT is ignored by most processes so this allows ExecStop to do its job.
  Systemd runs ExecStop then immediately sends KillSignal, which is TERM
  by default and therefore makes ExecStop useless.
  Second signal is SIGKILL, which kills all processes in the group.
